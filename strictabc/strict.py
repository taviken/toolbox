    Requires that the metaclass is ABCMeta or derived from it.  A
    class that has a metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be
    instantiated unless all of its abstract methods are overridden.
    The abstract methods can be called using any of the normal
    'super' call mechanisms.  abstractmethod() may be used to declare
    abstract methods for properties and descriptors.

    Usage:

        class C(metaclass=ABCMeta):
            @abstractmethod
            def my_abstract_method(self, arg1, arg2, argN):
